   The Blynk app serves as the system's user interface, enabling remote monitoring and visualization of health data. Through the app, users can access real-time health metrics, set alerts, and share data with healthcare providers. Its intuitive design and IoT compatibility make it an integral part of the system.  

### Working Mechanism  
The IoT-based Health Monitoring System operates seamlessly through the integration of its hardware and software components. Hereâ€™s an overview of its working mechanism:  

1. Data Collection  
   The sensors (AD8232, MAX30100, and pulse rate sensor) collect real-time health data such as ECG signals, oxygen saturation, and pulse rate.  

2. Data Processing 
   The ESP32 microcontroller processes the sensor data and prepares it for transmission. It also manages the OLED display to present the data locally.  

3. Data Transmission  
   Using Wi-Fi connectivity, the ESP32 transmits the processed data to the Blynk app interface. This allows users and healthcare providers to access the data remotely.  

4. Alert System  
   The system is programmed to trigger alerts in case of abnormal health parameters. For instance, if the oxygen level falls below 90%, an alert is sent to the connected devices via the Blynk app.  

5. Power Management 
   The lithium-ion battery powers the system, while the TP4056 module ensures safe charging. The system is designed to operate efficiently, minimizing power consumption.
